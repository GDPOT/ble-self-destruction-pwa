BLE Self-Destruction PWA
Project Overview
The BLE Self-Destruction PWA is a Progressive Web Application designed for scanning Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and initiating a self-destruct sequence on a selected device. It leverages modern web technologies to ensure broad compatibility and functionality.

Features
Scan for BLE Devices: Allows users to scan for nearby BLE devices.
Device Selection: Displays a list of discovered devices for user selection.
Connection: Establishes a connection with the selected BLE device.
Self-Destruction Command: Sends a command to trigger a self-destruct sequence on the connected device.
Offline Support: Utilizes service workers for offline functionality.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/automagicknight/ble-self-destruction-pwa.git
cd ble-self-destruction-pwa
Setup:

Open the project directory in your code editor.
Serve the application using a local web server (e.g., Python's http.server).
Launch:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
Usage
Click the "Scan for BLE Devices" button to start scanning.
Select a device from the list to establish a connection.
Send the self-destruct command to initiate the sequence on the chosen device.
