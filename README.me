# BLE Self-Destruction PWA

This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows users to scan for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and initiate a self-destruction sequence on a selected device. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with support for service workers to enable offline functionality.

## Features

- Scan for nearby BLE devices
- Display a list of discovered devices
- Connect to a selected BLE device
- Send a self-destruction command to the device
- Offline support via service workers

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ble-self-destruction-pwa.git
    cd ble-self-destruction-pwa
    ```

2. Open the project directory in your code editor.

3. Serve the application using a local web server. For example, using Python:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

1. Click the "Scan for BLE Devices" button to start scanning for nearby BLE devices.
2. Select a device from the list by clicking on it.
3. The application will connect to the selected device and send the self-destruction command.

## File Structure

```

└── manifest.json
```

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the application.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file that handles BLE scanning and device communication.
- **service-worker.js**: The service worker file for offline support.
- **manifest.json**: The web app manifest file that defines the PWA metadata.

## PWA Features

- **Manifest File**: The `manifest.json` file provides metadata for the PWA, including the name, short name, start URL, display mode, background color, theme color, and icons.
- **Service Worker**: The `service-worker.js` file enables offline support by caching essential files and serving them when the network is unavailable.
